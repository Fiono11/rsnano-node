# Fields may need to be defined in the context of a [category] above them.
# The desired configuration changes should be placed in config-node.toml in the node data path.
# To change a value from its default, uncomment (erasing #) the corresponding field.
# It is not recommended to uncomment every field, as the default value for important fields may change in the future. Only change what you need.
# Additional information for notable configuration options is available in https://docs.nano.org/running-a-node/configuration/#notable-configuration-options
